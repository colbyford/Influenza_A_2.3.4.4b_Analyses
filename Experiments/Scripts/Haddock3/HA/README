# Measuring Binding Affinity of H5N1 HA to Human and Avian Sailic Acid

## Step 1
Separate sialic acid from PDB structures found in science paper: "A single mutation in bovine influenza H5N1 hemagglutinin switches specificity to human receptors"
- 4K63 - LSTa (avian)
- 4KDO - LSTc (human)
* Only the SIA was extracted

## Step 2
Fold sequence of H5N1 (EPI3171488 A/Texas/37/2024) HA protein using AlphaFold2.

## Step 3
Dock HA protein with the extracted structure of both LSTa and LSTc using HADDOCK3 (https://www.bonvinlab.org/education/HADDOCK3/HADDOCK3-protein-glycan/).
