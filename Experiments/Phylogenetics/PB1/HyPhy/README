# Running HyPhy in SLURM on the HPC

1. You will need to install 'expect' into your environment. I did this through conda as shown below:

`conda install conda-forge::expect`

2. Create your expect file and change the permissions to be executible. 
- The expect file is replacing the *.ctl file so you will need to adjust the paths to you alignment and tree in this file. 

`chmod +x hyphy_expect.sh`

3. Execute the SLURM script.

`sbatch hyphy_slurm.sh`
